# Comparing Numerical Integration Techniques and Enhancing Calculus.py: Automating Linting and Testing with GitHub Actions

## Task Overview:
- Compare the numpy integration functions to the ones found in compphys
- Add missing docstrings in calculus.py
- Reuse github actions for linting and unit tests for calculus.py
- Write unit tests for functions in calculus.py

# Numerical Integration Comparision:  NumPy vs Compphys

NumPy, the core Python library for scientific computing, provides numerous functions for numerical integration.
